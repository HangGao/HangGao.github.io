This article was a brief translation of the blog post [Nine levels of EM algorithm](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NbM4sY93kaG5qshzgZzZIQ) by Chunqi Shi. It aims at providing a clear view of 
understanding of EM algorithm. In specific, Shi divides his understanding of EM algorithm into 9 levels. If you have any question or doubt about this article, pls contact me @ hanggao1@umbc.edu

# [](#header-1) 9 Levels of EM Algorithm Comprehension 
1. EM is E + M
2. EM is a way to construct local lower bound
3. K-means is a Hard EM algorithm
4. From EM to general EM
5. VBEM is a special case of general EM
6. WS algorithm is another special case of general EM
7. Gibbs Sampling is also a special case of general EM
8. WS algorithm is a brief version of VAE and GAN combination
9. The unity of KL divergence

## [](#header-2) EM algorithm is E expectation + M maximization

|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
